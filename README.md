The source code as I work through the Pragamtic Studio course - "Full Stack Phoenix"


# Raffley

This codebase is the result of following along with the pragmatic studio course "Full Stack Phoenix". This app is the one that you make as you're going along with it all. There's a second app that you build on your own based on the steps you've just been guided through.

## Copyright.

The copyright to the code is owned by Pragamatic Studio.

Whilst I technically typed the code, I did so following along with the video tutorials. In copyright terms it is considered to be a derivate work. I make no assertion on the copyright and I've made my derivate work public to demonstrate that I've completed the course.

If there are any issues with this being public drop me an email [me@treejamie.com][0] and we can talk about it.
